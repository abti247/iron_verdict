# Project Overview

**JudgeMe** - a web app for powerlifting competition judging.

The goal of the app is to provide an easy access to a tool for powerlifting judging.

## Project Structure
- Place all application implementation files (code, modules, components) under /src directory.
- Place all application documentation files under /docs directory.
- Place all test files and test-related code under /tests directory.

## GitHub
- Before committing any files, ask the user for confirmation if you're uncertain whether they should be committed, especially for generated files, logs, cache files, or system files.
- Never commit dependency directories, build artifacts, .env files, IDE configs, logs, or cache files; when in doubt about any file, ask before committing.
- Set up worktrees for the implementation of plans

## Plan Mode
- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
