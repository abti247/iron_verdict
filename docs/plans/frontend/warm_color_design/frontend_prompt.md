The judgme app needs an improved UI and frontend design. Use the /superpowers:brainstorm to help me create a design plan.

## Instructions

The app will be used by judges on their phones or tablets. The display screen will mostly be showcased on a tv or projector. The screens should scale accordingly.

The landing page should shortly describe the app and then focus on the features of creating and joining a session. The button for creating a demo requires less focus.

After creating or joining a session, the user continues to the screen for choosing a role - here they either pick left judge, head judge, right judge or display. The buttons should be in 2 rows, while the first row has the buttons for the judges and the second row for the display screen.

For the display screen, the most important thing is that the result and display timer are clearly visible even from afar. The 3 lights, representing the voting result are to be in one row. The lights don't need a label as the left represents the left judge, middle the head judge and right the right judge.

For the judges, the buttons for voting need to be clearly visible and big enough so mistakes in voting is less likely. At the top of the screen for judges, they need to see which judge position they have, the code of the session and the timer. Put the judge position to the left, session code to the right and the timer prominent in the middle. The buttons are below. The judges are able to vote a lift with a button for for white, red, blue and yellow. The lights on the display screen are to show these exact colors.
