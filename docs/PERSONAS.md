- Role: Athlete Liaison / Attempt Coordinator
- Technical Proficiency: Basic to Intermediate
- Frequency: Works 10-15 competitions per year

### Background

- Role: Platform Crew / Weight Loader
- Technical Proficiency: Basic
- Frequency: Works 8-12 competitions per year

### Background
Jake is part of the platform crew responsible for loading and unloading weights on the barbell between attempts. His job requires speed, accuracy, and focus - he needs to know exactly which plates to load for the next attempt before the athlete steps on the platform. Loading errors cause delays and can even affect athlete performance.

### Goals
- **Primary:** See next lifter's name and attempt weight clearly
- Calculate exact plate loading (how many 25kg, 20kg, 15kg, 10kg, 5kg, 2.5kg, 1.25kg plates per side)
- See plate breakdown visually - not just a number
- See height settings for rack (squat, bench) and safeties (bench)
- Know when to start preparing (see "on deck" athletes)
- Avoid loading wrong weight (embarrassing and delays competition)
- Work quickly to keep competition flowing

### Pain Points
- **Mental math under pressure:** Calculating plate combinations during live competition is stressful
- **Weight errors:** Loading wrong weight causes delays and frustrates athletes
- **No advance notice:** Not knowing next weight until athlete is already on platform
- **Bar math confusion:** Easy to miscalculate when tired after hours of loading
- **Small screens:** Hard to see information from platform position (often 10-15 feet from device)
- **Quick changes:** Athlete Manager updates weight, loaders need to know immediately

### Motivations
- Takes pride in fast, accurate plate loading
- Wants to keep competition moving smoothly
- Enjoys being part of the competition crew
- Values tools that make his physical job easier
- Wants to avoid embarrassing mistakes in front of athletes and audience

### Technology Usage
- Glances at tablet or phone mounted near platform
- Needs large, clear display readable from distance
- Basic comfort with apps
- Prefers visual information over numbers (plate diagram better than "127.5kg")
- Needs auto-updating display (hands are often full with plates)

### Specific Needs
- **Plate Breakdown Calculator:**
  - Show: "25kg x2, 20kg x1, 5kg x1, 2.5kg x1" (per side)
  - Visual representation: colored plate diagram
  - Account for 20kg bar
  - Display updates instantly when Athlete Manager changes weight

- **Next 2-3 Athletes:**
  - See upcoming lifts to prepare mentally
  - Identify big weight jumps that need extra time

- **Current Athlete Highlight:**
  - Large, bold display of active lifter
  - Attempt number (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
  - Total weight on bar

### Quote
> "Tell me what plates to load before the athlete gets on the platform. Don't make me do math in my head - just show me the plates."

## Persona 5: Referee (Marcus, Jessica, David) - Single Judge URL with Position Selection

**Demographics:**
- Age: 32-45
- Role: Certified Referees (State to National Level)
- Position: **Select on first load:** LEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT
- Technical Proficiency: Basic to Intermediate
- Frequency: Judges 2-5 competitions per month

### Background
Marcus (center), Jessica (left), and David (right) are the three referees for today's competition. They've all been judging for 5-10 years. Instead of receiving three different URLs, they all receive the **same judge URL** and select their position when they first open it. The center position gets additional timer controls, while left/right positions see a simplified voting interface.

### Goals
- **Primary:** Access judging interface quickly via single link (no login, no confusion)
- **Select position clearly:** Choose LEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT on first load
- **Vote on lifts** with large, clear WHITE/RED buttons
- **(CENTER only)** Start and reset the 60-second countdown timer
- **Change votes** if fat-finger error occurs (before all 3 judges vote)
- See current lift information clearly (athlete, lift type, attempt, weight)
- Have a fast, responsive interface that doesn't slow down the competition

### Pain Points
- **URL confusion:** Three different judge URLs is confusing to distribute and explain
- **Position mix-ups:** Judges accidentally opening wrong URL and seeing wrong interface
- **Account fatigue:** Tired of creating accounts for different competition systems
- **Small buttons:** Accidentally votes wrong because buttons are too small on phone
- **Interface complexity:** Overly complex UIs distract from judging
- **(CENTER only)** Needs clear START CLOCK and RESET CLOCK buttons without cluttering vote interface
- **Position conflicts:** Two judges trying to claim same position simultaneously

### Motivations
- Values professionalism and appearing competent
- Wants to focus on watching lifts (not fumbling with technology)
- Appreciates systems that respect their time
- **(CENTER)** Takes head referee role seriously (additional authority and responsibility)
- **(LEFT/RIGHT)** Values simplicity - just wants to vote, nothing else

### Technology Usage
- Uses personal smartphones (various models, 2-4 years old)
- **(CENTER)** May use competition-provided tablet (preferred for extra screen space)
- Basic to intermediate comfort with apps and web browsing
- Prefers simple, obvious interfaces
- Needs large touch targets for quick, accurate interactions

### Position Selection Flow
1. **First Load:** All three judges open the same URL
2. **Position Screen:** See three large buttons: [LEFT] [CENTER] [RIGHT]
3. **Selection:** Each judge clicks their position (button highlights and stays pressed)
4. **Position Lock:** Server marks position as taken (other judges can't select it)
5. **UI Adaptation:** Interface changes based on position:
   - **CENTER:** Shows START CLOCK, RESET CLOCK, WHITE, RED buttons
   - **LEFT/RIGHT:** Shows only WHITE and RED buttons (simplified)
6. **Conflict Prevention:** If two judges click same position simultaneously, first request wins, second sees "Position already taken, please select another position"

### Position Release Flow
Judges may need to switch positions during competition (bathroom break, fatigue, etc.). The system allows position release with safety constraints:

1. **Release Constraint:** No judge can release their position while the timer is running
   - Prevents mid-lift position changes that could disrupt competition
   - Applies to ALL positions (LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT)

2. **CENTER Judge Release:**
   - Must wait until timer stops naturally (reaches 0 or athlete lifts), OR
   - Press RESET to stop timer and set it to 60 seconds (timer does NOT auto-start)
   - Then press "Release Position" button

3. **LEFT/RIGHT Judge Release:**
   - Must wait until timer is not running
   - Press "Release Position" button

4. **After Release:**
   - Position becomes available for selection again
   - Judge who released returns to position selection screen
   - Another judge (or same judge) can claim the now-available position

5. **Timer RESET Behavior (CENTER only):**
   - Stops timer immediately if running
   - Sets timer to 60 seconds
   - Timer state: READY (not running)
   - Judge must press START to begin countdown

### Quotes
**Marcus (CENTER):**
> "I select center position and get the timer controls I need. Simple. I don't need three different URLs to remember."

**Jessica (LEFT):**
> "I pick LEFT and my screen stays clean - just the vote buttons. Perfect."

**David (RIGHT):**
> "One URL for all three of us? Finally, a system that makes sense."

## Anti-Persona: Not Our Target User

**Name:** Large Federation IT Manager
**Profile:** Manages technology for national powerlifting federation with 10,000+ members

**Why NOT a fit:**
- Needs enterprise-grade federation management
- Requires complex user hierarchies and permissions
- Needs integrated membership databases and rankings
- Requires multi-meet scheduling and calendar management
- Needs certification tracking and judge assignment systems
- Wants white-label branding and customization

**Why JudgeMe isn't for them:**
JudgeMe is designed for simplicity and ease-of-use at **individual competitions**. Federation-scale management with complex hierarchies, certifications, and enterprise features is explicitly out of scope for the MVP. These users need platforms like Lift inghouse, OpenPowerlifting integration, or custom enterprise solutions.
